# py2DIC

py2DIC is a free and open source software for 2D DIC developed at the Geodesy and Geomatics Division, University of Rome "La Sapienza"

The software is based on the template matching method, a well-known technique for matching patterns based upon
cross-correlation, and returns the displacement and strain field by comparing 
two or more images of the specimen acquired at different stages of deformation.
